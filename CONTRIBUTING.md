# Prerequisites

- Have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- Have [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (NPM comes with Node, so you don't have to download it in particular).

# Installation

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork in your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORKED_REPO.git
```

3. Run `npm install` or the shorthand `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
4. Create a new branch.

```bash
git checkout -b your-new-branch
```

5. Run the dev server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. After doing your work, push the changes to GitHub.

```bash
git push -u origin your-new-branch
```

7. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the main repository.
